# CPU-Scheduling-Algorithms-Simulation
🎯 Objectives

Simulated and compared multiple CPU scheduling algorithms to analyze their efficiency and fairness.

Focused on key scheduling strategies including First-Come, First-Served (FCFS), Shortest Job Next (SJN), Priority Scheduling, and Round Robin (RR).

Aimed to measure and visualize average waiting time, turnaround time, and CPU utilization across algorithms.

⚙️ Tools & Technologies

C++ / Python for algorithm implementation and simulation.

Matplotlib / Console output for comparative visualization of scheduling metrics.

Applied data structures such as queues and priority lists to manage process scheduling.

📊 Results

Built a simulation demonstrating performance differences between preemptive and non-preemptive scheduling methods.

Identified algorithm trade-offs in efficiency, responsiveness, and fairness under various workload conditions.

Reinforced understanding of operating system process management and resource allocation strategies.
